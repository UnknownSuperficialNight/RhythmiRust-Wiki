		{ "Text": "Alternatively, you can add an album art directory called 'album_art', and any images with the supported formats will be randomised and used as album art, again only if no embedded image is present." },

			"Text": "If you want to override any embedded images or the normal album art, you can use override types such as 'override_album_art' or 'override_cover' (either as files or directories), which will take priority over all other album art including embedded images."

		{ "Text": "Supported formats for all album art types including 'album_art', 'cover', 'override_album_art', and 'override_cover' are: PNG, JPG, JPEG, and WebP." },
		{ "Text": "The recommended image format is PNG, as this is what the other formats are converted to internally." }
