		{ "Header2": "The Origin of RhythmiRust" },
		{ "Text": "RhythmiRust started as 2 bash scripts: one for downloading, one for searching." },
		{ "Text": "Of course, this became hard to manage and use, so I decided that I should probably combine them" },
		{ "Text": "into a single application that also works cross-platform." },
		{ "Text": "Thus RhythmiRust was born." },

		{ "Header2": "Why make RhythmiRust" },
		{ "Text": "I wanted to make a \"music player\" due to the lack of one that offered a search feature, let alone a downloader." },
		{ "Text": "My primary aim was to make an effortless method for downloading/syncing videos from platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud;" },
		{ "Text": "these downloaded files would then be stored locally for preservation and playback." },
		{ "Text": "RhythmiRust was intended to be an efficient, portable, feature-rich and lightweight application." },
		{ "Text": "This means minimal CPU and RAM usage, and a fully portable cross-platform configuration" },
		{ "Text": "with album art support." },

		{ "Header2": "The Influence of Music on RhythmiRust's Development" },
		{ "Text": "As a music enthusiast with a vast collection of 16,561 songs," },
		{ "Text": "I desired an easy method to search through and play them, and download/sync new additions." },

		{ "Header2": "The Core Values Guiding the Development of RhythmiRust" },
		{ "Text": "RhythmiRust should maintain a consistent GUI appearance." },
		{ "Text": "No elements should appear outside of the GUI (such as opening system file dialogue)." },
		{ "Text": "The application should be self-contained, requiring minimal external dependencies." },
		{ "Text": "RhythmiRust has only two external dependencies: one for network/download functionality and another for converting formats." }
