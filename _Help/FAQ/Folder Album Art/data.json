		{ "Text": "Alternatively: You can add album art directory called 'album_art' and any images with the supported formats will be randomised and used as album art, again only if no embedded image is present." },
		{ "Text": "If you want to override any embedded images, you can use 'override_album_art' (file or directory), which will take priority over all other album art." },
		{ "Text": "Supported formats for both 'album_art' and 'override_album_art' are (png, jpg, jpeg, webp)." },
		{ "Text": "Recommended image format is 'png' as this is what the other formats are converted to internally." }
