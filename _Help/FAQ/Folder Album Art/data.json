		{ "Text": "Alternatively, you can add an album art directory called 'album_art', and any images with the supported formats will be randomised and used as album art, again only if no embedded image is present." },
		{ "Text": "If you want to override any embedded images, you can use 'override_album_art' (file or directory), which will take priority over all other album art." },
		{ "Text": "Supported formats for both 'album_art' and 'override_album_art' are: PNG, JPG, JPEG, and WebP." },
		{ "Text": "The recommended image format is PNG, as this is what the other formats are converted to internally." }
